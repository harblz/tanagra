# Tanagra

This is an open-source project to create a free [AAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentative_and_alternative_communication) platform for people who do not / cannot communicate vocally. 

# Verbal Behavior meets the AAC Universe
This project was built and maintained by behavior analysts and as such is based off the principles of verbal behavior. Words in Tanagra are not just parts of speech but, also, tacts, mands, autoclitics, etc. as per Skinner's analysis of verbal behavior.
