# Tanagra
##### More Talk, less action.

Tanagra is a free & open source [AAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentative_and_alternative_communication) platform for people who do not / cannot communicate vocally. 

The name comes from an episode of [Star Trek: The Next Generation](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Darmok_(episode)), from Captain Picard:

> "In my experience, communication is a matter of patience, imagination. I would like to believe that these are qualities that we have in sufficient measure."

For those who work with individuals with special needs when it comes to communication, patience and imagination are important. Patience to provide consistent and conceptually sound teaching procedures, and the imagination try to understand what your learner is trying to communicate so you can foster the growth of independent requests (mands), labels (tacts), and other types of speech as the learner advances. This can be a difficult process, for both us as listeners, and for our learners, as communicators. It's about time technology made this process easier for us.


## Built with Verbal Behavior in Mind
##### Verbal Behavior meets the AAC Universe

This project was built and maintained by behavior analysts and as such is based off the principles of verbal behavior per Skinner's analysis of behavior and the wealth of research that has occurred since. Words in Tanagra are not just parts of speech but are tacts, mands, autoclitics, etc. - the environment can be controlled in a systematic way by separating out the teacher's view and the learner's view, allowing a teacher to control the screen of a learner remotely to prompt communication errorlessly. In addition, the learner is freed from having adults interrupting access to their device to add / remove buttons when needed. Tanagra uses a grid system, similar to many other AAC apps, however, the grid system is designed to be flexible and it is easy to rapidly create "distractor arrays" or similar teaching setups that are classically used by behavior analysts, speech language pathologists, and special education teachers in the day-to-day teaching of new mands and tacts. Folders and tabs can be automatically set to "shuffle" so that buttons automatically shuffle their position during teaching to foster the acquisition more accurate conditional discriminations. For advanced / fluent communicators, this can of course be turned off if they find these features annoying.


## Data Collection - Intuitive & Easy
##### Data is not a second class citizen in Tanagra

Data is taken automatically by the platform in teaching mode. Accuracy is scored on a trial-by-trial basis, and trials can be controlled by a user on another device remotely. Position bias can be automatically calculated by trends in the users response across a class of targets. Field size can be progressively faded as the communicator meets specific criteria. 


## Cross Platform
